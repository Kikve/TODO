# Enum 

### Palabras clave



### Contenido

Class  defines operations on sequentially ordered types.

The `enumFrom`... methods are used in Haskell's translation of arithmetic sequences.

Instances of  may be derived for any enumeration type (types whose constructors have no fields). The nullary constructors are assumed to be numbered left-to-right by  from `0` through `n-1`.
