# values

> [!NOTE]
>To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must
separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information. In a [[📑javascript (eloj)|javascript]]
environment, those chunks are called __values__.

- Every __value__ has a [[📑type  (eloj)|type]] that determines its role.

- __values__ are __numbers__, some values are pieces of text, some values are functions,
