A [[📑tags (h&c)|tag]] To create a __paragraph__


```html
<p>A <html>
 paragraph consists of one or more sentences
that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
line.</p>
<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
into units of text. For example, a book may have
chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
each heading there will be one or more
paragraphs.</p>
