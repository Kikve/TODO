# list 



[[📑list (pytt)|list]] are __mutable__   and their _elements are usually homogeneous_ and are accessed by iterating over the [[📑list (pytt)|list]].

- __appends and pops__ from the end of list are fast,

> [!NOTE] 
>  It is also possible to use a list as a __queue__
>  
>   [[📑list (pytt)|lists]] _are not efficient_ for this purpose. While  doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow  
>   use [[📑deque (pytt)|deque]]
