- Essence of functional programming is that programs are a combination of [[📑expression (hpf)|expressions]] combinated with other [[📑expression (hpf)|expressions]]

- [[📑function (hpf)|functions]] are __first-class__:
     they can be used as values or passed as arguments, or inputs 
     
- Are all based on the [[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]]
- **purity** in [[📑functional programming (hpf)|functional programming]]  means called  that is called [[📑referencial transparency (hpf)|referencial transparency]]
- Are built from separate, independent [[📑function (hpf)|functions]] 
- high degree of abstraction and composability.
- [[📑abstraction (hpf)|abstraction]] allows you to write shorter, more concise programs by factoring common, repeated structures .
