[[📑number (jdg)|Number]], is used to represent integers and to
approximate real numbers. 

JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard,1 which means it can represent num‐
bers as large as ±1.7976931348623157 × 10$^{308}$ and as small as ±5 × 10$^{-324}$

The JavaScript number format allows you to exactly represent all integers between −9,007,199,254,740,992 (−2$^{53}$) and 9,007,199,254,740,992 (2$^{53}$), inclusive.
