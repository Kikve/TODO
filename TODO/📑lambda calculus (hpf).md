Like __Turing__ machines, the [[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]] formalizes the concept of __eﬀective computability__, thus determining which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved

 [[📑computation consist (hpf)|computation consist]]


[[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]] is a process or __method__, like a game with a few
