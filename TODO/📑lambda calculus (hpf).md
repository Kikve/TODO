> [!NOTE] 
 is a formal system for expressing programs in terms of [[📑abstraction (hpf)|abstraction]] and [[📑beta reduction (hpf)|application]].
 
__lambda calculus__, a model of computation devised in the 1930s by __Alonzo Church__

The [[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]] is one process for __formalizing a method__. 
Like __Turing__ machines, the [[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]] formalizes the concept of __eﬀective computability__, thus determining which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved

 [[📑computation consist (hpf)|computation consist]]


[[📑lambda calculus (hpf)|lambda calculus]] is a process or __method__, like a game with a few
simple rules for transforming [[📑lambda term (hpf)|lambdas]]
