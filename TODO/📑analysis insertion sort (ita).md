# 📑analysis insertion sort
<div class="hash">(4fdb5d)</div>

The time taken by the [[📑insertion sort (ita)|insertion sort]] procedure depends on the input:


can take different amounts of time to sort two input sequences of the same size depending on how nearly sorted they already are

the time taken by an algorithm grows with the size of the input([[📑input size (ita)|input size]])

compute the [[📑running time (ita)|running time]]

> [!NOTE] Best case running time
> the best case occurs if the array is already sorted
