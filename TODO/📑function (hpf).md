- A __function__ is a relation between a set of possible inputs and a set of possible outputs. 

- [[📑referencial transparency (hpf)|referencial transparency]]  given the same input, the output should be predictable.
-  A [[📑function (hpf)|function]] is an [[📑expression (hpf)|expression]] that is __appliad__ to an __argument__ and always returns a result
- __evaluate__ a [[📑function (hpf)|function]] to the same result when given the same values.
- all [[📑function (hpf)|functions]] in [[📑haskell (hpf)|haskell]] take one argument and return one result -> [[📑currying (hpf)|currying]]
- The relationship between the input, 𝑥, and the output is described in the [[📑function (hpf)|function]] body
