- Clarity
When you see a tuple in code, you know its length will never change.
- Performance
A [[📑tuple (flup)|tuple]] uses less memory than a list of the same length, and it allows Python
to do some optimizations.


 References in a [[📑tuple (flup)|tuple]] cannot be deleted or replaced. But if one of
those references points to a mutable object, and that object is changed, then the value
of the tuple changes
