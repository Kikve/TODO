 - dictionaries are indexed by _keys_ which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.
 - [[📑tuples (pytt)|tuples]] can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples
 - You can’t use [[📑list (pytt)|lists]] as keys
-  A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: `{}`. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs
