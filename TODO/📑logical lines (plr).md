#nota/📑


The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE. Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE is allowed by the syntax (e.g., between statements in compound statements). 

A logical line is constructed from one or more [[📑physical lines (plr)|physical lines]] by following the explicit or implicit _line joining_ rules.
