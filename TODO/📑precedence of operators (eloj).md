# Precedence of operators

When [[📑operators (eloj)|operators]] appear together without parentheses, the order in which
they are applied is determined by the __precedence of the operators__

levels of operators
1.  `+ - `
2. `* /  ,  %`

> [!NOTE] 
>When multiple [[📑operators (eloj)|operators]] with the same
precedence appear next to each other they are applied left to
right
