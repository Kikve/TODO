[[📑object type (jdg)|objects]] are sometimes called __reference types__ to distinguish them from JavaScript’s
primitive types. Using this terminology, object values are references, and we say that
objects are compared by reference:

Objects are not compared by value: two distinct objects are not equal even if they have the same properties and values

object values are references, and we say that objects are compared by reference

 assigning an object (or array) to a variable simply assigns the reference: it does not create a new copy of the object
