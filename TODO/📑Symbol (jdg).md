[[📑Symbol (jdg)|symbols]] were introduced in ES6 to serve as __non-string__ property names.

To obtain a [[📑Symbol (jdg)|Symbol]] value, you call the __Symbol() function__. This __function__ never returns the same value twice,

you can safely use that [[📑value (jdg)|value]] as a property name to add a new property to an [[📑object type (jdg)|object]] and do not need to worry that you might be overwriting an existing property with the same name

[[📑symbol for keyfor (jdg)|for, keyfor]]
