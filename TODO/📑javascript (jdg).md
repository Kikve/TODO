[[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]] was created at __Netscape__ in the early days of the web, and technically, “JavaScript” is a trademark licensed from __Sun Microsystems__

__Netscape__ submitted the language for standardization to __ECMA__—the __European Computer Manufacturer’s Association__

__ES6__ was released in 2015 and added major new features—including __class__ and __module__ syntax

But in ES5 and later, programs can opt in to [[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]]’s strict mode in which a number of early language mistakes have been corrected

Legacy [[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]] and strict  [[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]]. In __ES6__ and later, the use of new language features often implicitly invokes __strict mode__. For example, if you use the ES6 class keyword or create an ES6 module, then all the code within the class or module is automatically strict, and the old, flawed features are not available in those contexts. 

Since 2010, another host environment has been available for [[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]] code.
 __Node__ gives [[📑javascript (jdg)|javascript]] access to the entire operating system
