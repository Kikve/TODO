__Expressions__ include concrete values, [[📑lambda variable (hpf)|variables]], and also [[📑function (hpf)|functions]]

[[📑expression (hpf)|expressions]] may be __values__, __combinations of values__, and/or [[📑function (hpf)|functions]] applied to __values__. [[📑expression (hpf)|expressions]] evaluate to a result. In the case of a literal value, the evaluation is trivial as it only evaluates to itself.

[[📑expression (hpf)|expressions]] are the building blocks 

reduce expression [[📑beta reduction (hpf)|beta reduction]]
We say that expressions are in [[📑normal beta form  (hpf)|normal form]] when there are no more evaluation steps that can be taken,


[[📑function (hpf)|function]] is a specific type of [[📑expression (hpf)|expression]]
