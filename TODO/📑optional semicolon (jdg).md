JavaScript uses the __semicolon__ (;) to separate
__statements__

you can usually omit the __semicolon__ between two __statements__ if those statements are written on separate lines.

In general, if a __statement__ begins with (, \[, /, +, or -, there is a chance that it could be interpreted as a continuation of the __statement__ before.


> [!important] exceptions
>- __return, throw, yield, break, and continue__ statements always interpret that line break as a __semicolon__.
>
>- ++ and −− operators must appear on the same line as the __expression__ they apply to
> 
>-  using concise __“arrow” syntax__: the => arrow itself must appear on the same line as the __parameter list__.
