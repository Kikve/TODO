Any JavaScript __value__ that is not a [[📑number (jdg)|number]], a [[📑string (jdg)|string]], a [[📑boolean (jdg)|boolean]], a [[📑Symbol (jdg)|Symbol]], [[📑null (jdg)|null]], or [[📑undefined (jdg)|undefined]] is an [[📑object type (jdg)|object]].

[[📑object type (jdg)|objects]] are not compared by value: two distinct objects are not equal even if they have the same properties and values

[[📑object type (jdg)|objects]] __values__ are __references__, and we say that [[📑object type (jdg)|objects]] are compared by reference:

[[📑object type (jdg)|object]] are mutable

An [[📑object type (jdg)|object]] (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of __properties__ where each property has a __name and a value__

One very special object, the [[📑global object (jdg)|global object]]

[[📑object type (jdg)|object]] are different than [[📑primitive type (jdg)|primitive type]]. First, they are mutable their values can change

[[📑object type (jdg)|objects]] are sometimes called reference types

[[📑object type (jdg)|object]] is an unordered collection of named values

- [[📑array (jdg)|array]]  ordered [[📑object type (jdg)|object]]
- [[📑set (jdg)|set]] represent a set of values
- [[📑Map (jdg)|Map]]  represents a mapping from keys to values
- [[📑RegExp (jdg)|RegExp]]  textual patterns
