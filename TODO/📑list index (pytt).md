#nota/📑

-  __list.index(x\[, start\[, end\])__

	Return zero-based index in the [[📑list (pytt)|list]] of the first item whose value is equal to _x_. Raises a __ValueError___ if there is no such item.

	The optional arguments _start_ and _end_ are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the c[[📑list (pytt)|list]]. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the _start_ argument.
