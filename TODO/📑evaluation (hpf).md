reducing the terms until the [[📑expression (hpf)|expression]] reaches its simplest form. Once a term has reached its simplest form, we say that it is irreducible([[📑beta reduction (hpf)|beta reduction]]) or finished evaluating. Usually, we call this a __value__. 


Haskell uses a nonstrict evaluation (sometimes called “lazy evaluation”

__Values are irreducible__, but applications of [[📑function (hpf)|functions]] to __arguments__ are reducible

Values are expressions, but cannot be reduced further. Values are a terminal point of __reduction__
